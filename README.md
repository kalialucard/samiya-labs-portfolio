## ⚡ Core Operational Features

- **Signal Hub Contact Interface**: A terminal-inspired console for secure communication with real-time pulsing visualizers and port-mapped social connectivity.
- **Automated Intelligence Feed**: Dynamic "Live Intelligence Feed" on the home node simulating real-time system activity and discovery logs.
- **Unified DevHub**: A searchable knowledge base for technical research, tool validation, and command cheatsheets.
- **Automated Build System**: Custom Python-based static site generator (`manage.py`) that transforms Markdown research into interactive, themed HTML writeups.
- **CRT Simulation**: High-fidelity visual processing effects including scanlines, subtle flicker, and phosphor persistence for an immersive operative experience.

## 🛠️ Operational Instructions

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.x (for content compilation)
- Modern browser (support for CSS backdrop-filters)

### 2. Building Intelligence
To compile new Markdown research from `content/` into the production `posts/` directory and update site grids:
```bash
python manage.py build
```

### 3. Creating New Research Node
To initialize a new template for technical research:
```bash
python manage.py new <category>
# Categories: writeups, cheatsheet, blogs, docs, testing
```
