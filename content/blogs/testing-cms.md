# Testing the New CMS

If you can see this, the **Technical Intelligence Labs Content Management System** is officially online.

## Features tested:
1. Markdown parsing with YAML Front Matter.
2. Automatic page generation in `posts/`.
3. Multi-page card grid updates.
4. "Recent Intelligence" update on the homepage.

```python
def success():
    print("CMS Build Successful!")
```
