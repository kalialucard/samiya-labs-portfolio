# Enterprise Network Hardening

This project focuses on the implementation of a comprehensive network security architecture for a simulated enterprise environment.

## Key Components:
- **Perimeter Defense**: Deployment of high-throughput firewalls with deep packet inspection.
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Implementation of Snort/Suricata rulesets tailored to modern threats.
- **Micro-segmentation**: Isolation of critical assets into dedicated security zones.
